Planning and Problem-Solving Strategies:

I planned to stick to the schedule but, it was not that easy. I had a problem
every step of the way. First, I asked my colleagues and if they couldn't help
me, then, I opened up an issue. Then, I tried to work on something else, but,
I was not always able to do so.  I found myself getting really frustrated and tried to work through the frustration. I didn't take the recommended breaks. I only took
breaks when I completed something. But, I found when I was forced to take a
break, I did come back with a clear mind and figured things out that I was
staring at for 20+ min.

User Stories:

As a user, I would like to be able to tell how many games I've won.
As a user, I would like to choose the level of difficulty
As a user, I want to be able to choose which letter I am.

# browser-template

A template for starting front-end projects. Webpack for `require` system, build
pipeline, and development server. Boostrap and Handlebars.js included. No
front-end frameworks included.

## Installation

1.  [Download](../../archive/master.zip) this template.
1.  Unzip and rename the template directory.
1.  Empty [`README.md`](README.md) and fill with your own content.
1.  Replace all instances of `ga-wdi-boston.browser-template` with the name of your project.
1.  Move into the new project and `git init`
1.  Add all of the files in your project with the command `git add -A`
  -   *Note:* THIS IS THE ONLY TIME YOU SHOULD RUN THIS COMMAND
1.  Commit all of your files with the command `git commit`
  -   Your commit title should read `Initial commit`
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Structure

Developers should store JavaScript files in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts).
The "manifest" or entry-point is
[`assets/scripts/index.js`](assets/scripts/index.js). In general, only
application initialization goes in this file. It's normal for developers to
start putting all code in this file, but encourage them to break out different
responsibilities and use the `require` syntax put references where they're
needed.

Developers should set `config.apiOrigins.production` (and
`config.apiOrigins.development` if it differs from the default).  With
`apiOrigins` set, developers may rely on `config.apiOrigin` as the base for API
URLs.

Developers should store styles in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and load them
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss).

Developers should use [getFormFields](forms.md) to retrieve form data to send to
an API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA, run `grunt deploy`.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
-   `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard Style
-   `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
-   `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
